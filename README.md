## üåü Version 6.0.0 Preview

Version 6.0.0 is a complete rewrite of this project in C/C++. It:

- actually works, with less pain;
- is blazing fast, thanks to the redesigned efficient pipeline and the speed of C/C++;
- is cross-platform, available right now for both Windows and Linux;
- supports Anime4K v4 and all other custom MPV-compatible GLSL shaders;
- supports RealESRGAN (all three models) via ncnn and Vulkan;
- requires 0 disk space for processing the video, just space for storing the final output; and
- exports a standard C function that can be easily integrated in your own projects!

These are available for download now:

- 6.0.0 beta CLI preview builds for Windows and Linux are on the [releases page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases).
  - You will need to install the dependencies and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the Linux build to work. Refer to the [PKGBUILD](PKGBUILD) file to see what needs to be installed.
  - Alternatively, you can build it from source. Take a look at the [Makefile](Makefile).
- 6.0.0 beta AUR package for Arch Linux (`video2x-git`).
- 6.0.0 beta [container image](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/pkgs/container/video2x).
- A GUI for 6.0.0 is in the making. More information about it will be available soon.

There is still much to be done and optimize. Stay tuned for more updates. As for why the 5.0.0 branch was abandoned, here are some of the reasons:

- Wrapped C++ libraries for Python is too painful to build for cross-platform distribution.
- Some wrapped C++ libraires exhibited unexpected behaviors.
- Running FFmpeg via commands and piping data through stdin/stdout are inefficient.
- C/C++ native binaries are much smaller and much more efficient.

## [üí¨ Telegram Discussion Group](https://t.me/video2x)

Join our Telegram discussion group to ask any questions you have about Video2X, chat directly with the developers, or discuss about super resolution technologies and the future of Video2X in general.

## [ü™ü Download Windows Releases](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases/tag/4.8.1)

The latest Windows update is built based on version 4.8.1. GUI is not available for 6.0.0 yet, but is already under development. Go to the [GUI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/GUI) page to see the basic usages of the GUI. Try the [mirror](https://files.k4yt3x.com/Projects/Video2X/latest) if you can't download releases directly from GitHub.

## [üìî Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gWEwcA9y57EsxwOjmLNmNMXPsafw0kGo)

You can use Video2X on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) **for free** if you don't have a powerful GPU of your own. You can borrow a powerful GPU (Tesla K80, T4, P4, or P100) on Google's server for free for a maximum of 12 hours per session. **Please use the free resource fairly** and do not create sessions back-to-back and run upscaling 24/7. This might result in you getting banned. You can get [Colab Pro/Pro+](https://colab.research.google.com/signup/pricing) if you'd like to use better GPUs and get longer runtimes. Usage instructions are embedded in the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gWEwcA9y57EsxwOjmLNmNMXPsafw0kGo).

## [üì¶ Container Image](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/pkgs/container/video2x)

Video2X container images are available on the GitHub Container Registry for easy deployment on Linux and macOS. If you already have Docker/Podman installed, only one command is needed to start upscaling a video. For more information on how to use Video2X's Docker image, please refer to the [documentations](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Container).

## [üìñ Documentations](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki)

Video2X's documentations are hosted on this repository's [Wiki page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki). It includes comprehensive explanations for how to use the [GUI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/GUI), the [CLI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/CLI), the [container image](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Container), the [library](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/Library), and more. The Wiki is open to edits by the community, so you, yes you, can also correct errors or add new contents to the documentations.

## Introduction

Video2X is a video/GIF/image upscaling and frame interpolation software written in Python. It can use these following state-of-the-art algorithms to increase the resolution and frame rate of your video/GIF/image. More information about the algorithms that it supports can be found in [the documentations](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/Algorithms).
